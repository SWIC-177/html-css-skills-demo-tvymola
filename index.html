    <p>
      I am currently learning to become a web developer. I am actively learning
      how to use GitHub and Visual Studio Code, along with Git Bash and some of
      the GitHub extensions. I work full time as an eBusiness Analyst and I am
      hoping to use my new skills to transfer to a new role within my company. I
      have two dogs, Bella and Gus, who are spoiled rotten. I have a passion for
      gardening and grow tropical plants from seeds. I have three sisters who
      are all living in the local area and I am very close with them all. We are
      currently working together to move my parents from their home in Florida
      to be closer to us here in the Midwest. I am looking forward to spending
      more time with them and helping them to get settled in their new home.
